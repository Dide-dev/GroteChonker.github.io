            <h1>Defend Samidoun, Defend Our Right to Political Self-Determination!</h1>
            <p>Following the example of Germany, Canada, and the United States, the Dutch government plans to ban Samidoun, a network for solidarity with Palestinian prisoners, by labeling it as a terrorist organization.</p>
            <p>These plans are part of a broader attack on the Palestine movement. Members of Parliament have shared intentions to monitor other groups as well, potentially leading to further bans. This includes organizations such as Utrecht4Palestine and PGNL, which advocate for the Palestinian cause.</p>
            <p>A ban on Samidoun could have far-reaching consequences for the entire Palestine movement, potentially setting the stage for banning Utrecht4Palestine and PGNL as well. Therefore, we call for solidarity and unity — this is where we draw the line!</p>
            <h2>Why Samidoun?</h2>
            <p>Samidoun has a more radical political stance than many other organizations fighting for the liberation of Palestine. Founded in 2011, Samidoun was initiated to organize solidarity actions for Palestinian prisoners. According to Mohammed Khatib, Samidoun's European coordinator, it is a "grassroots organization." Samidoun organizes lectures, actions, and demonstrations. They do not view prisoners as victims but as political actors. Through this perspective, they aim to raise awareness of the Palestinian struggle and build a movement.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Samidoun is transparent about its political ideas. It is one of the few organizations that openly supports Palestinian resistance. In this regard, Samidoun is unique. Undoubtedly, this openness is why it has become the primary target of these proposed restrictions..</p>
            <h2>Ideology</h2>
            <p>Samidoun is rooted in socialism. It asserts that the root cause of Palestinian oppression lies in the capitalist system and its mechanisms. According to Samidoun, Israel is part of the Western capitalist power bloc. Those who established the state of Israel migrated to Palestine before and after 1948 to occupy the land. The indigenous Palestinians were dispossessed during this period and have since lost the few rights they had left. Then and now, Palestinians resist this dispossession.</p>
            <p>For Western capitalists, Israel is an important trade partner, and Israel is dependent on the West for its survival. Therefore, Israel will always serve Western interests. Western powers, in turn, have a vested interest in ensuring Israel's continued existence. However, Israel can only survive by systematically oppressing Palestinians and dispossessing them of their land. The arms trade is a key component of Israel's economy, with Palestinians often used as "test subjects" for new weapons. Israel's economic expansion is intrinsically linked to the ongoing appropriation of land.</p>
            <p>Recognizing Israel's right to exist as a state would represent a defeat for Palestinians, as it would force millions of Palestinians worldwide to abandon their right to return to Palestine. In this context, giving up armed resistance against Israel is tantamount to surrender.</p>
            <h2>'Terrorism'</h2>
            <p>Palestinian resistance organizations have been criminalized by the West and labeled as "terrorist." This is similar to how the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa, the civil rights movement in the U.S., and the independence movement in India were once branded as terrorists. The term "terrorism" is weaponized by our rulers — the capitalists — to discredit their political adversaries. They side with Israel. As a result of the legal implications, many organizations shy away from supporting Palestinian resistance. Samidoun, however, stands principled in its support.</p>
            <p>The Dutch state and capitalists show no regard for the more than 100,000 Palestinians killed in the past year alone, nor for the millions of victims since 1948. As long as profits are to be made, they remain indifferent to the mass starvation, killings, rape, torture, bombings, and burning alive of Palestinians.</p>
            <p>They find it inconvenient that organizations like Samidoun in the Netherlands refuse to be silenced, refusing to accept the narrative that Palestinian resistance is terrorism. It is therefore in their interest to spread lies about these organizations and to push for their prohibition.</p>
            <p>We must demand the freedom to declare our own support for causes we believe in. We should not be forced by the government to recognize Israel's right to exist, nor forced to accept the criminalization of expressing support for the Palestinian resistance.</p>
            <p>For this reason, we express our unwavering support for Samidoun and firmly reject the accusations made by the Dutch state!</p>
